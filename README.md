🔐 Integrating Automated Security Scanning into DevOps Pipelines with SonarQube and Trivy

This project focuses on integrating automated security scanning and code quality analysis into DevOps pipelines using **SonarQube** for static code analysis and **Trivy** for container vulnerability scanning. The goal is to ensure **secure, high-quality, and production-ready applications** with continuous feedback during development and deployment phases.

## 📖 About the Project

In this project, we:

* Implemented **SonarQube** for code quality and security analysis.
* Integrated **Trivy** to scan Docker images for vulnerabilities.
* Embedded security scans into **CI/CD pipelines** using GitHub Actions.
* Configured pipelines to **fail on high/critical vulnerabilities**.
* Visualized scan results and ensured **developer-friendly feedback loops**.
* Ensured compliance with DevSecOps principles for secure delivery.

## ✅ FEATURES

👉 Integrated **SonarQube** for code smells, bugs, and security hotspots
👉 Automated **Trivy** scans for container vulnerabilities
👉 GitHub Actions fail builds on **critical/high vulnerabilities**
👉 Centralized **scan reports** and **code quality dashboards**
👉 Lightweight and extensible CI/CD configuration
👉 **Shift-left security**: Catch issues early in development

---

## 🚀 GETTING STARTED

### Prerequisites

👉 Docker
👉 GitHub Account
👉 GitHub Actions enabled
👉 SonarQube Server (local or cloud)
👉 Trivy CLI

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git  
cd your-repo-name  
```

### Set up SonarQube (locally)

```bash
docker run -d --name sonarqube -p 9000:9000 sonarqube  
```

### Install Trivy

```bash
brew install aquasecurity/trivy/trivy   # macOS  
sudo apt install trivy                  # Ubuntu  
```

## 🔄 CI/CD & Security Integration

👉 **GitHub Actions Workflow**

* `build.yml`: Runs on push, triggers SonarQube scan and builds image
* `security-scan.yml`: Runs Trivy on the built image and checks for CVEs

👉 **SonarQube Integration**

* Sonar token and project key in GitHub Secrets
* Automatic PR comments for issues

👉 **Trivy Integration**

* Fail builds if image has CRITICAL or HIGH vulnerabilities
* JSON reports exported for auditing
